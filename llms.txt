# flutter_kiwi_nlp

> Flutter plugin for Korean morphological analysis powered by Kiwi, with a
> unified `KiwiAnalyzer` API across native FFI (Android, iOS, macOS, Linux,
> Windows) and web WASM.

This repository is a package, not an application.
When making changes, preserve API parity between native and web backends.

Model initialization can be zero-config with bundled assets, but platform build
steps and model path resolution rules are important for reliable integration.
